As the years went by anytime my family got some sort of new technology,I was the one setting it up and trouble shooting any issues.That started my interest in technology primarily computers.So, at that point I wanted to be a computer engineer. By taking certain electives in high school I liked the software side more and by doing my research about the field I felt that studying computer science would be the best path. As I would have more electives to choose from than if I studied software engineering."

However, as I person that learns best in person/face to face and my professor travelling due to other commitments. I had to adapt and learn on my own fairly quickly as I had to send weekly reports on what I had researched. My weakness is that I tend to overthink things. Sometimes when I’m seeing something new or the task ahead is huge, I overthink how complicated the issue really is. I always go back to what one of my professors said and that’s divide and conquer."
